= Dandi Docker Images

This folder contains Dockerfiles to build various Docker images for Dandi:

* `Dockerfile` and `Dockerfile.gpu` provide Jupyter(R) notebooks for datascience. The `Dockerfile.gpu` enables the use of GPU.
* `Dockerfile.matlab` provides a jupyter environment with MATLAB(R) installed. This image requires you to bring your own licence.
* `Dockerfile.gpu.matlab` provides a jupyter environment with MATLAB(R) installed with GPUs support. This image requires you to bring your own licence.


== MATLAB Docker Image

The MATLAB Docker image relies on the {matlab_byoi}[MATLAB Integration for Jupyter in a Docker Container] BYOI (Build Your Own Image).
It is shipped with https://github.com/mathworks/matlab-proxy[MATLAB-proxy] which enables communication with MATLAB from a web-browser, and with https://github.com/mathworks/jupyter-matlab-proxy[MATLAB-proxy-jupyter] which adds MATLAB integration for Jupyter.

This Dockerfile includes the following toolboxes:

* Bioinformatic Toolbox
* Computer Vision Toolbox
* Curve Fitting Toolbox
* Deep Learning Toolbox
* Econometrics Toolbox
* Image Processing Toolbox
* Optimization Toolbox
* Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
* Signal Processing Toolbox
* Parallel Computing Toolbox
* Financial Toolbox
* Wavelet Toolbox

This Dockerfile includes the following add-ons:

* matnwb v2.6.0.2
* Brain-Observatory-Toolbox bleeding edge
* CIATHA master branch version
* EXCTRACT master branch version
* Deep Learning Toolbox Converter for Tensorflow models


=== How to Build

Building the MATLAB Docker image is straight forward.
The following lines consider that you already cloned the repository and that you are positioned in the `docker` folder in the cloned repository on your file system.

[source, bash]
----
docker build -t dandi-matlab - < Dockerfile.matlab

# or

docker build -r dandi-matlab-gpu - < Dockerfile.gpu.matlab
----

This will build the image tagging it as `dandi-matlab` (or `dandi-matlab-gpu`).

=== How to Run

Running a container for the built image requires that a port is passed to the command line to tell the container which internal port needs to be exposed and on which port to map it in the host system.

[source, bash]
----
docker run -p 8888:8888 dandi-matlab:latest
----

This command considers the exposition of port `8888` and maps it to the port `8888` in the host.
The syntax of the option is `-p [host port]:[container port]`.
The port to expose in the container is always `8888`, but the host port can be changed to what is the best for your system.

After the container started, you can check the logs and you will see lines giving you the address you can open in your web browser to start the Jupyter instance.

[source]
----
To access the server, open this file in a browser:
    file:///home/jovyan/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/jpserver-6-open.html
Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
    http://78bd0f342a19:8888/lab?token=6bf3ad4d468ab3532fab610f5ff28dcf27b1b60300ec8e0c
 or http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=6bf3ad4d468ab3532fab610f5ff28dcf27b1b60300ec8e0c
----

To open locally the Jupyter, copy/paste the `127.0.0.1:8888/xxxxx` address in your browser.

CAUTION: If you changed the port on which will be mapped the internal container port, do not forget to change it also in the address you copy/paste from the logs.

=== Closing your Session

Be careful while closing your session.
If you don't close the session properly prior to stop your container, _i.e_: closing the MATLAB session and disconnecting yourself, there is chances that the MATLAB licencing system sees yourself as still connected and you'll have to wait the timeout of the session to be able to log/connect again after restarting the container.

To properly close your session, click on the `MATLAB Jupyter Setting` button which appears above the MATLAB top bar.
From there, if you really want to close your session, clic on "Stop MATLAB Session", and if you really want to stop your Jupyter session, clic on "Sign Out".

=== Add new Add-Ons

By default, the `Dockerfile.matlab` and `Dockerfile.gpu.matlab` images are shipped with some addons already installed and accessible from MATLAB.
You can easily add/remove addons by changing some lines in the Dockerfile: the addons links to download/install are defined by the `ARG ADDONS_RELEASES` and the `ARG ADDONS_LATEST` variable:

The `ADDONS_RELEASES` variable:: is used to point towards tagged versions of the addon (releases for which a zip file have been produced by the repository maintainers).

The `ADDONS_LATEST` variable:: is used to point towards a repository from which the last version of the code should be installed (a link towards the github repository only).

CAUTION: The download links have to be release links towards `.zip` files.

==== How the Add-On Registration is Working

The add-ons registration is actually performed in two steps happening at two differents times: at "docker image construction" time, and at MATLAB startup time.

During the docker image construction, all add-ons referenced by the `ADDONS` variable in the Dockerfile are downloaded and extracted in a specific folder: `/opt/extras/dandi`.

At startup-time, this folder is automatically scanned by MATLAB and all downloaded add-ons are added to the "path" of MATLAB.
The code responsible for the auto-scan of the add-ons folder is directly injected in the `startup.m` file during the docker image construction.
If some add-ons require extra actions after being installed/added to the path, you can modify these lines to add extra action before the `clear`:

[source,dockerfile]
----
RUN echo -e "\n\
addons = dir('${ADDONS_DIR}'); \n\
addons = setdiff({addons([addons.isdir]).name}, {'.', '..'}); \n\
for addon_idx = 1:numel(addons) \n\
    addpath(genpath(strcat('${ADDONS_DIR}/', addons{addon_idx}))); \n\
end \n\
generateCore();  % Generate the most recent nwb-schema \n\
% ciapkg.io.loadDependencies('guiEnabled', 0);  % Load dependencies for CIAtah \n\
% ADD HERE EXTRA ACTIONS FOR YOUR ADD-ON IF REQUIRED! \n\
clear" >> /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/matlab_proxy/matlab/startup.m
----

=== Customize your Container

You can customize some parameter of your container changing some variables in the `Dockerfile.matlab`.

You can impact those parameters:

`ADDONS_DIR`::
This variable defines where the add-ons must be downloaded/extracted and what will be the folder scanned by MATLAB at startup time.
If you change this folder, the Jupyter user needs to have read/write access to it. This comes from a specificity of `matnwb` which requires the execution of some extra actions for its activation.

`ADDONS_RELEASE`::
This variable defines the list of add-ons to download and install. You can add as much add-ons as you want as long as they are compatible with MATLAB-R22, MATLAB-R23 and MATLAB-R24 (depending on the Dockerfile you are building).

`ADDONS_LATEST`::
This variable defines the list of add-ons to download and install directly from the lastest version identified in the github repository.
